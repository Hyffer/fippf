# DNS rule is a list, each item contains matcher and resolver.
# Matcher:
# - "regex" matches domain name with regular expression.
#           syntax: https://pkg.go.dev/regexp/syntax
# - "geosite" matches geolocation of domain name
# Resolver:
# The value of resolver should be one of
# - "block" block/drop this query
# - "fakeip" using fake IP address
# - "direct" solve DNS query with `dns_direct` provided above
# - "upstream" solve DNS query with DNS server provided by DHCP (not supported yet)

# Items are checked sequentially in the given order.
# When one item matches, i.e. all matchers in this item match, its resolver is used.
# An item with no matcher is always matched, as a convenient way to set default resolver.
# If no item matches, the default is "fakeip".

# Rule only applied to A and AAAA queries,
# others are passed through to `dns_direct` provided above
